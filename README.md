## Enable local area communication protocol

To make Gateway integration possible (and WolkConnect-Python-Xiaomi to work) it is required to enable lan protocol.
Here are required steps:

* Install Mi Home from Play store [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaomi.smarthome) or [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/app/mi-home-xiaomi-for-your-smarthome/id957323480).
* Set region to Mainland China (this is mandatory). You can access this feature from main screen via: Profile-Settings-Region.get 

* Pair your gateway with you mobile device and select WiFi.

* Select Gateway from your device list. You shoud see a screen like this:

```sh
# Device parameters
serial = "1234567890"
password = "4b74c38c-a6bf-4e6f-9698-3eac3b65905e"

# xiaomi gateway password
gatewayPassword = "0987654321"
```

```sh
 python3 wolk-python-xiaomi.py 
```
to connect to Wolkabout platform.
